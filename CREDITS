This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have 
contributed to the Nuke project. It is sorted by name and
formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification by 
scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address
(W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D), and
snail-mail address (S).
Thanks,
